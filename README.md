# SRCDS-Easy-start Rewrite

> ### Basic premise
>
> - Offer a semi-structured way to host multiple source engine dedicated servers on a machine
> - Add a method of automatically restarting any server after a crash or exit
> - Log events happening on the server in a seperate file
> - Neatly organize its features into easy to understand modules
> - Use JSON files for better user configuration

> ### Current features
> - Can read from json files and store their data in RAM during runtime
> - Silent flag implemented (for command line), lets the jar act as a seperate log and (eventually) restart the server during crashes

This is a passion project, and help is welcome!

> I've archived the old code in seperate branch for reference.
> The old code is extremely messy and unstable, and 
> I have no plans of maintaining or repairing it.
